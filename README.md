CSE4500 Repo

- First 2 commits, compeleted core assignments. Used node-fetch in the api problem to fetch the given URL. Pretty cool stuff!
- Second update. Can't seem to figure out how to upload all of my Unity project onto Github. Too many files. I managed to get some of it onto here but 2 folders have too many files to be uploaded. But I created a project and setup Firebase integration with it. I set up a little enviorement with obstacles. Will add a player and movement sometime soon.
